References
---------

I strongly recommend to read and use Geb's manual: The Book of Geb: [http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/all.html](http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/all.html).
Offline version of this book is attached to this project in `geb-manual-0.9` directory.

We use Spring Webflow Example as a sample application to test. It's original repository is placed here: [https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-webflow-samples](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-webflow-samples).
However, a copy of this repository is attatched to this project for offline access.

Geb application is originally based on Luke Daley's example application: [https://github.com/geb/geb-example-gradle](https://github.com/geb/geb-example-gradle).
If you want to start from scratch look up in forks for versions updated to latest dependencies.
